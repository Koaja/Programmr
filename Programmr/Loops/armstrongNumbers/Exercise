 Armstrong Numbers


Using nested for loops, find all the three-digit Armstrong numbers. 
Armstrong numbers are three digit numbers such that the sum of the digits cubed is equal to the number itself.

For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153

However, 294 is not, because 2³ + 9³ + 4³ = 801 (not 294)

Output:

153
