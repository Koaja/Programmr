Suppose we have a database composed of two fields or columns (arrays), the first field is for the username (user[]) and the other one is for the password(pass[]) .

This is how it looks like:

user[0] = “John” ;

user[1] =”Bob”;

 user[2]=”ArnoldSchwarzenegger” ;

And their passwords correspond with their indexes.

pass[0] = “123”;

pass[1] = “456”;

pass[2] = “theterminator”;

Then if one of them had successfully login, the output should be:

Enter username: John

Enter password: 123 //(no need to encrypt LOL)

Hello John!  

But if not, "Incorrect Login!" &am
