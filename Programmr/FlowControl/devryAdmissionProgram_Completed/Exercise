Write a program that reads user input for a student's grade point average and SAT exam score, and uses these values to decide whether the student is admitted to the university.
A GPA below 1.8 will cause the student to be rejected; and a SAT score below 900 will also cause a rejection.
Otherwise the student is accepted.
If both the GPA and the SAT score are too low, print the message about the GPA being too low. Your output should match the following:

Devry University Admission Program
Enter your GPA out of 5:1.9
Enter your SAT Score:900
You were accepted

 

Devry University Admission Program
Enter your GPA out of 5:1.2
Enter your SAT Score:300
Your GPA is too low

 

Devry University Admission Program
Enter your GPA out of 5:3.5
Enter your SAT Score:600
Your SAT score is too low
