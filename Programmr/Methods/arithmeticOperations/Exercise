In the below exercise, implement the Sum, Difference and Product methods. The main() method holds two integer variables. The program will take inputs from the user.

Sum(): Takes 2 integers as inputs and computes the sum and displays the sum, returns void.
Difference(): Takes 2 integers as inputs and computes the difference and displays the difference, returns void.
Product(): Takes 2 integers as inputs and computes their multiplication and returns the multiplication answer. 
This method does not display the answer. Instead, it should return the answer to the calling main() program, which displays the answer.

Note:Do not use getters and setters.

Example1:
Inputs:
Enter first number:
5
Enter second number:
2

Outputs:
7
3
10

Example2:
Inputs:
Enter first number:
10
Enter second number:
5

Outputs:
15
5
50
