Make a Java program that accepts two strings (str1 and str2) as an input from the user. 
Using a method, "mixString(String a, String b)", 
create a bigger string made of the first char of str1, the first char str2, the second char of str1, the second char of str2, and so on. 
Any leftover chars go at the end of the result. Print the result at the end. 

Enter first string:
abc
Enter second string:
xyz
axbycz
 

Enter first string:
Hi
Enter second string:
There
