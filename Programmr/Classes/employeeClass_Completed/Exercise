Create a class called Employee that includes three instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive,  set its value to 0.

A test application named Challenge that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities.
