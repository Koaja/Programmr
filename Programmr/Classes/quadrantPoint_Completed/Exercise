Create a class called Point that includes two instance variables - x(type int) and y(type int). 
Provide a constructor that initializes the two instance variables. Provide the following function in the Point class:

public int quadrant()

Following function should return which quadrant of x/y this point object falls in. 
Quadrant 1 contains all points whose x and y values are both positive. 
Quadrant 2 contains all points with negative x but positive y.
Quadrant 3 contains all points with negative x and y values. 
Quadrant 4 contains all points with positive x but negative y. 
If the point lies directly on x and/or y axis return 0.

Write test application named Challenge that demonstrates class Point's capabilities. Create a Point object and display object's quadrant.

Enter x coordinate:
1
Enter y coordinate:
2
Quadrant 1
 

Enter x coordinate:
-1
Enter y coordinate:
2
Quadrant 2
