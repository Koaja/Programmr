Write a program to ask a string from user and check if it is a palindrome or not.

Hint: Palindrome strings are those strings which are same whether read from the front or back. eg 'mom', 'dad', 'nitin', 'madam'

 

Input: 
Enter a String:
madam

Entered string is a palindrome.


Input:
Enter a String:
abc
