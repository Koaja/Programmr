Write a program to convert roman numerals into their arabic equivalent. Here are the arabic equivalents for roman symbols:

The "basic" roman symbols                                 The "auxiliary" roman symbols

I         X      C       M                                           V     L      D

1        10     100    1000                                     5     50     500

Convert the roman numeral to arabic processing the symbols from left to right according to the following rules:

1. A symbol following one of greater or equal value adds to its value. (E.g., XII = 12) 

2. A symbol preceding one of greater value subtracts its value.(E.g., IV = 4; XL = 40)
