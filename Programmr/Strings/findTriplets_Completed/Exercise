Make a Java program that accepts a string as an input. Use the following method:

public static int countTriplets(String str)

The method must return the number of triplets in the given string. 
We'll say that a "triplet" in a string is a char appearing three times in a row. The triples may overlap.

Enter a string:
abcXXXabc
1
 

Enter a string:
xxxabyyyycd
3
